abstract = "Recent advances in graphics processing units (GPUs) technology open a new era in high performance computing. Applications of GPUs to scientific computations are attracting a lot of attention due to their low cost in conjunction with their inherently remarkable performance features and the recently enhanced computational precision and improved programming tools. Domain decomposition methods (DDM) constitute today an important category of methods for the solution of highly demanding problems in simulation-based applied science and engineering. Among them, dual domain decomposition methods have been successfully applied in a variety of problems in both sequential as well as in parallel/distributed processing systems. In this work, we demonstrate the implementation of the FETI method to a hybrid CPU–GPU computing environment. Parametric tests on implicit finite element structural mechanics benchmark problems revealed the tremendous potential of this type of hybrid computing environment as a result of the full exploitation of multi-core CPU hardware resources and the intrinsic software and hardware features of the GPUs as well as the numerical properties of the solution method."

    abstract = "{High-order numerical diffusion is commonly used in numerical models to provide scale selective control over small-scale noise. Conventional high-order schemes have undesirable side effects, however: they can introduce noise themselves. Two types of monotonic high-order diffusion schemes are proposed. One is based on flux correction/limiting on the corrective fluxes, which is the difference between a high-order (fourth order and above) diffusion scheme and a lower-order (typically second order) one. Overshooting and undershooting found in the solutions of higher-order diffusions near sharp gradients are prevented, while the highly selective property of damping is retained.The second simpler (flux limited) scheme simply ensures that the diffusive fluxes are always downgradient; otherwise, the fluxes are set to zero. This much simpler scheme yields as good a solution in 1D cases as and better solutions in 2D than the one using the first more elaborate flux limiter. The scheme also preserves monotonicity in the solutions and is computational much more efficient.The simple flux-limited fourth- and sixth-order diffusion schemes are also applied to thermal bubble convection. It is shown that overshooting and undershooting are consistently smaller when the flux-limited version of the high-order diffusion is used, no matter whether the advection scheme is monotonic or not. This conclusion applies to both scalar and momentum fields. Higher-order monotonic diffusion works better and even more so when used together with monotonic advection.}",
