# High-Level Programming Comparison

## Goals
This project aims to compare different high-level techniques in `python` in terms of usability and speed for stencil computations. 
As a use-case, the three dimensional heat equation is implemented and solved using `numpy`, `cupy`, `gt4py` and `devito`.

## Subdirectories

* **src** source code of the diferent stencils
* **tests** test files to validate the source code
* **run** bash files to run code on cscs
* **benchmark** benchmarking source code
